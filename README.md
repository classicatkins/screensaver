# screensavor This program will display multiple shapes of random size and color. These shapes will move across the screen and reverse direction when they hit the edge of the screen. The shapes should be stored in an array and should change color while moving. The program will iterate through the array using a foreach loop, updating the x and y coordinates of each individual shape.
